NAME
====

**DUE** â€” Docker User Environment. A build environment for your build environments.

SYNOPSIS
========

| **due** \[**-r|--run** _args_] \[_dedication_]
| **due** \[   **--create** _args_ ] \[_dedication_]
| **due** \[**-m**|**--manage** _args_] \[_dedication_]

| **due** \[**-h**|**--help**]

DESCRIPTION
===========

DUE is a set of wrapper scripts for both creating Docker container based
build environments, and running them with intelligent defaults so that
the user can feel like they are still on the host system.

Key features include:

 1 - Creating an account in the container for the user at run time and mounting
     the user's home/work directory so configuration files are available.

 2 - List based browsing of images to run and active containers to log in to.

 3 - Use of container 'templates' to preconfigure and build containers for a
     particular target or Debian based operating system,
     eliminating errors caused by missing dependencies, or misconfiguration.

 4 - Commands can be run using the container without having to log into it, allowing
     for use in automated build environments.


Functional Options
-------
Each of these options has context specific help and sub commands

-r, --run

:   Start new containers.

--build

:   Execute container's /usr/local/bin/duebuild script in current directory.
    See the --run section for more.

--create

:   Make and configure new Docker images.

-m, --manage

:   Manipulate and query existing images.

-h, --help

:   Usage information.

-v, --version

:   Print DUE's version number.

--run options
-------
These options are available after the --run argument, and relate to
starting and logging in to containers.

Starting an image
-------

-i, --run-image [filter]
:	Allows the user to reduce the number of images shown
to run by restricting them to entries that contain [filter]. If only one image
matches the filter, it will be invoked without asking the user to choose it.

-a, --all
:	Show all containers on the system. DUE can be used to log in to
containers that it did not create, but the user may have to supply a default
--username and --userid (usually --username root and --userid 0. See below )

--ignore type
:		 When accessing the container, do not attempt to create a user
account for the user logging in, and assume the container was not created by
DUE. This can be useful with image creation debug.

-c, --command [cmd]
:	Run [cmd] in the container using the --login-shell.
 This must be the last command parsed, as [cmd] is handed off to be run in
 the container. The primary use of this would be using the container to
 build without having to interactively log in to it.

 Note: when issuing multiple commands, remember to "" your arguments, and
 backslash (\) any semicolons (;) used to split up the commands. Otherwise the
 shell where the commands are invoked will take anything after the first ;, and
 treat it as a command to be run locally.

 This can obfuscate things if the command can work inside or out of the container.  

 Example: look at /proc and the password file in a container:
          ./due --run --command "ls -lrt /proc"  \; "cat /etc/passwd"

--build
:	If there is a /usr/local/bin/duebuild script in the container, this option
    will run it with a default configuration, or take additional passed
	arguments if present. Those arguments will vary depending on the nature of
	the target being built by the container's duebuild script.
	For more information, check the template/README.md for the image type, or
	type: --run --build help to get the container's duebuild script's help
	options directly.
	
--debug
:	Sets defaults of --username root --userid 0 and the --any option to show
images that were not created by DUE. Helpful for internal debug if image
creation dies running internal configuration scripts.

--home-dir [host path]
:   Absolute path to a directory to use as the home directory
 when the user logs in. Defaults to the user's home directory unless overridden
 with this argument, or set otherwise in /etc/due/due.conf, or ~/config/due/due.conf

--mount-dir [hp:cp]
:	Mount absolute path on host system (hp) at absolute path in
 container. The colon (:) is necessary to separate the two. Multiple --mount-dir
 commands can be used in a single invocation.
 Example: mount host /tmp dir in container /var/build:  --mount-dir /tmp/:var/build

Logging in to a running container
-------
-l, --login
:	Choose an existing container to log in to

--username  [username]
:	Name to use when logging in.

--userid    [id#]
:	User ID to use when logging in.

--groupname [groupname]
:	Container user's default group

--groupid   [id#]
:	ID of container user's group

--login-shell [path]
:	Program to use as login

--help-runtime
:	Invoke runtime help

--help-runtime-examples
:	Show examples of use

--create options
-------
These options are accessed after the --create argument, and,
predictably enough, relate to creating new images.


Creation Overview
-------

Containers created by DUE will always have files from ./templates/common-templates in
every image. The primary example of this is the **container-create-user.sh** script that sets up an
account for the user in the container, and allows commands to be run in the container as if
it was the user invoking them.

The order of creation is as follows, using the debian-package template as an example, where
the resulting image will be named 'debian-package-10'

1 - The contents of common-templates are copied to a debian-package-10-template-merge directory under
    ./due-build-merge/
2 - The contents of the debian-package template directory copied in to the 
    debian-package-10-template-merge directory and will overwrite any files with identical names.
3 - Any REPLACE_* fields in the *template files are replaced with values supplied from
    the command line (such as the starting container image)  and all files are copied to
	./due-build-merge/debian-package-10
4 - The ./due-build-merge/debian-package-10/Dockerfile.create file is used to create the image
    from this build directory. 

Creation tips
-------

Quick image changes can be made by editing the build directory ( ./due-build-merge/debian-package-10 )
and re running ./due --create --build-dir ./due-build-merge/debian-package-10

The final image will hold a /due-configuration directory, which holds everything that went into the image.
This is very useful for install script debug inside the container.

Creation example
-------

1 - Configure an image build directory under due-build-merge named from --name
Mandatory:

--from [name:tag]
:	Pull name:tag from registry to use as starting point for the image.

--use-template [role]
:	Use files from templates/[role] to generate the config directory.

--description "desc"
:	Quoted string to describe the container on login.

--name [name]
:	Name for resulting image and config directory.
    Ex: debian-stretch-build, ubuntu-18.04-build, etc

Optional:

--prompt [prompt]
:	Set in container prompt to [prompt] to provide user context

--no-image
:   With --create, allow directories to be created, but do not try
    to build the image. Effectively stops use of --dir.
	Useful for debugging directory configuration issues.
	
2 - Build a Docker image from the image build directory.

--dir [dirname]
:	  Build using an existing configuration directory.


--mangage options
-------
These options are accessed after the --manage argument, and can
make working with containers/images easier.

-l,  --list-images
:	 List images created by DUE.

--stop
:	 Use the menu interface to stop a running container. Works with
     --all to show containers not started by the user.
	 NOTE: since all DUE containers are started with -rm, stopping
	 a container deletes it and all the data in it from memory.

--snapshot [name]
:    Save a running container as a Docker image named name.

--copy-config
:    Create a personal DUE configuration file in ~/.config/due/due.config

--make-dev-dir [dir]
:    Populate a local directory for DUE container development.

--list-templates
:    List available templates.

--delete-matched [term]
:    Delete containers that contain this term. USE WITH CAUTION!

--git-clean
:    Run 'git -dfx' to remove untracked files in local dir.

--docker-clean
:    Run 'docker system prune ; docker image prune' to reclaim disk space.

--help-examples
:	Examples of using management options.
