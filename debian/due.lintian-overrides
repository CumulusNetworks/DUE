# Overriding the judgment of Lintian

# DUE Lintian override:  false positive, a `bash` script gets syntax check with `sh -n` ( but the
#   templates/common-templates/filesystem/usr/local/bin/duebuild: 31: Syntax error: "(" unexpected
# can be avoided )
due: shell-script-fails-syntax-check [usr/share/due/templates/common-templates/filesystem/usr/local/bin/duebuild]

# DUE Lintian override: these files are sourced by other files and are intentionally not executable,
#  but do have the '#!/bin/bash' for editor syntax formatting.

# DUE Lintian override: repeated paths are intentional for proper placement in the container.
# These directories represent where installation will take place in the Docker image, and be
# present in the container at run time. However, since directories for the image's /usr/share
# are stored under the host system's /usr/share, a false positive of repeating directory paths is detected.
