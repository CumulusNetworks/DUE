Description: Dedicated User Environment: manage build environments in Docker containers.
 DUE uses templates to generate target specific build images based on any
 version or architecture of any Debian release, and provides a launcher
 application to reduce complexity and let the developer 'just build it',
 whatever 'it' may happen to be.
